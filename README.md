# Bernoulli

This is my first ever experience working with android.
The App is definitely nothing big, but it solved a problem that I personally had in my everyday life.

When studing for my maths exam I didnâ€™t want to retype the Bernoulli Fromula :

for every one of my calculations. 
So I built this app.

This was also a great way to learn the very basics of Android and I took the knowledge I got here into my later projekts.
